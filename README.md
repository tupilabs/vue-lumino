# vue-lumino

A sample project showing one way to integrate [Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) (née PhosphorJS)
and Vue.js.

Lumino "is a library for building interactive web applications". It is used by JupyterLab to create the
top menu bar, widgets with close/maximize buttons, and other components that allow users to create
web applications.

Based on work done for [Cylc UI](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui).
